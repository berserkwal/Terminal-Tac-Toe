# Terminal-Tac-Toe                        

A terminal based Tic-Tac-Toe game build entirely in Python. The code might be a little messy in some decision statements and I didn't have time to make it appealing. I just kept adding conditions and it works fine and is understandable if you know how *if-else* statements work. Usbailty is not affected. Created the logic in under an hour, just tweaking the visibility of the grid in-game took most of my time. Looks good on a terminal if you have a beautiful monospace font like [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). The CPU plays randomly from a list of valid moves, so the marking won't be optimal but in most of the cases the random markings feel strategically placed. Great for passing time. You can also play with your friend locally.

## Features of this game:

* Uses only predefined modules. No custom modules used, except the ones made by me for this code.

* Options to choose between playing against the CPU (random moves) or against your friend.

* Works on all platforms. I have included only the batch script to run it on Windows but you can create your own scripts for the platform you use to run the game.
